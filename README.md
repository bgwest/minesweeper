## minesweeper_cli / websweeper

###### minesweeper_cli
a terminal based minesweeper that can be launched with node. It takes user input for tile selecting. see notes in game.js for how to run the project with node.

*note: does not include logic for tile clearing -- plans for this in websweeper version*


###### websweeper - converting minesweeper_cli to my iteration of a web version (in process - 05/26/18).
Converting minesweeper_cli to a web version called, "websweeper".

The intention/goal is to create a 'minesweeper-like replica' that uses most of the tradionally known rules / game play, but aim to add my little touch / twist to the game. There are plently of minesweeper games out there so maybe a twist will be invited.

My plan for moving it to a web version is to start by keeping it as simple as possible. 
That may mean things like, for example:

* showing an "*" with a red tile for a bomb instead of finding or creating nice vector images.

Once it is all functional, I will go back and re-evaluate where things can be improved and features. This might also help keep the commits and code easy to follow in clear increments.

Will update readme as needed, I just wanted to restate where this project is at.

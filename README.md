## minesweeper_cli / websweeper

###### minesweeper_cli
A terminal based minesweeper that can be launched with node that takes user input for tile selecting. See notes in minesweeper_cli/src/game.js for how to run the project with node.

*note: minesweeper_cli currently does not include logic for tile clearing. I have plans for this in websweeper version below.*

###### websweeper - converting minesweeper_cli to a web version - 'my iteration of the game' (in progress - 05/26/18).
The intention/scope of this project is to create a 'minesweeper-like replica' that uses most of the tradional rules / game play we all know of as minesweeper, but with a personal twist. There are plently of minesweeper games out there so maybe a twist would be invited. That is currently the train of thought anyway.

My plan for moving it to a web version is to start by keeping it as simple as possible. 

That may mean things like:

* showing a "*" with a red tile for a bomb instead of finding or creating nice vector images.
* not focusing on mobile responsiveness or global device compatibility 
* not super pretty UI
* etc.

Once the project is all functional, I will go back and re-evaluate where things can be improved and addition of features. This might also naturally help keep commits easy to follow as the project evolves over the next week.

Will update readme as needed. I just wanted to restate where this project is at in case anyone stubmled upon it and wondered it's state.

*I looked up heigh-ho and it appears to be 75% "negative" and 25% "positive"? Heigh-ho?*

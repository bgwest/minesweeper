## minesweeper_cli / websweeper

###### minesweeper_cli
A terminal based minesweeper that can be launched with node that takes user input for tile selecting. See notes in minesweeper_cli/src/game.js for how to run the project with node.

*note: minesweeper_cli currently does not include logic for tile clearing. I have plans for this in websweeper version below.*

###### 'websweeper' - converting minesweeper_cli to a web version - 'my iteration of the game' (in progress - 05/26/18).
The intention/scope of this project is to create a 'minesweeper-like replica' that uses most of the tradional rules / game play we all know of as minesweeper, but using purely svgs to genereate and manipulate the game board. The other goal is to eventually add a 'personal twist' to the game that is not traditional, which is a stretch goal to visit after the initial web version is created.

My plan for moving it to a web version, to start, is keeping the game creation as simple as possible.

e.g.

- Using basic svg/text elements generated with javascript that can be easily manipulated
- Not super pretty UI or animations
- no music / sound fx
- hosted on github to avoid the complexity of manually hosting and setting up a public name

Once the project is all functional, I will go back and re-evaluate where things can be improved and addition of features.

Will update readme as I go, I just wanted to restate where this project is at in case anyone stubmled upon it and wondered it's state.

##### That's it for now.
